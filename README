Every file in this repository was written for CSIS 352 at Minnesota State
University Moorhead. It was the fourth assignment completed for this course.

Program Description

sortedList is a templated, sorted, ordered list. It stores items in either
ascending or descending order.

Input/Output

main.cpp contains a test program that demonstrates the functionality offered by
this class. It does not require input to run, but will output to the terminal.

Program Design

This is implemented as a singly-linked structure; the list is a pointer to a
node type, which contains a data item and a pointer to another node type. These 
nodes are linked together by the pointers.
Since the position an item is inserted into depends on how it compares to the
currently-existing items, there is no sort algorithm being employed.

Program Testing

This program was designed by drawing the logical view of the list and writing
out every step of the methods. It was tested as it was developed, to be sure
that the expected behavior was (or appeared to be) happening. Methods were
tested individually with all possible cases; for example, insertItem was tested
with no items, one item, and several items, and multiple insert positions were
checked.

Bugs

No bugs are currently known to exist.
